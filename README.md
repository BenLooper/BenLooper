### Hey! 你好!

I'm Ben, welcome to my Github!

### _A Little About Me_
I love working with others, systematically attacking problems, and making weird/interesting stuff.

### _My Current Role_
I'm studying to become a full stack software engineer at Flaitron School. I graduate early December, and can't wait to officially become a developer! 

### _The Last Thing I Worked On_
We just finished learning Rails and tons of backend stuff. I also got to style a bit using CSS and Bootstrap.

It culminated in a project that I was given 5 days to work on, called [ArtWalk](https://github.com/BenLooper/Mod2Project) (essentially "Instagram for Artists").

While I'm not terribly fond of social media, modeling such a domain was a fun and interesting challenge for me.

### _What's Next?_
We're moving on to JavaScript to make our (until now) rather dull front-ends a little more dynamic.

### _Side Projects!_
  - Build up my Pick a Path story program called [Navigator](https://github.com/BenLooper/Navigator)
  - Style my [personal blog](http://benlooper.net/) with my new styling skills
  - Make a basic portfolio site (hosted on Github) to showcase things I'm working on
  - Turn my raspberry pi into an [ad blocker](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/pi-hole-raspberry-pi/) for my apartment!
