### Hey! 你好!

I'm Ben, welcome to my Github!

### _A Little About Me_
I love working with others, systematically attacking problems, and making weird/interesting stuff.

### _My Current Role_
I'm an Associate Software Engineer at Infosys - currently I'm in a Devops role for a contract at United Airlines! 

### _The Last Thing I Worked On_
I'm currently obsessed with frontend development, specifically React. 

My last substantial side project was [Rogue Moon](https://github.com/BenLooper/RogueMoon), a game where you wrestle control of the moon from the clutches of a rogue AI by...playing it in cards (inspired by Gwent from the Witcher 3).  

At work, I've been working heavily with AWS Cloudformation (and by extension, many other services), basic Kubernetes stuff, and creating pipelines on TeamCity. 

### _What's Next?_
I have an ever growing list of things I'm interested in studying/making in my free time, be sure to check (my website)[benlooper.tech] for updates on side projects.
My goal for my next project is to have the backend be entirely serverless with AWS. After that, I want to learn Django as an API for a React frontend.
I'm learning a lot in my current role at UAL. Something I want to improve upon more is my familiarity with Microservices Architecture.

### _Side Projects!_
  - Have Rogue Moon fully operational on AWS 
  - Learn Golang 
  - Learn testing for React 
  - Learn Django
