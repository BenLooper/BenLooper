### Hey! 你好!

I'm Ben, welcome to my Github!

### _A Little About Me_
I love working with others, systematically attacking problems, and making weird/interesting stuff.

### _My Current Role_
I'm a full stack software engineer at Contract Land Staff in Houston (.NET / Angular / React / SQL / ESRI ).

### _The Last Thing I Worked On_
My last substantial side project was [Tap Tourney](https://www.taptourney.com/), a community-driven game about tapping as fast as you can (made with AWS Amplify and React). 

### _What's Next?_
I have an ever growing list of things I'm interested in studying/making in my free time, be sure to check [my website](https://benlooper.tech/) for updates on side projects.

### _Side Projects!_
  - Nothing right now I've been working too much :(
