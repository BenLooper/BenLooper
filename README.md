### Hey! 你好!

I'm Ben, welcome to my Github!

### _A Little About Me_
I love working with others, systematically attacking problems, and making weird/interesting stuff.

### _My Current Role_
I'm studying to become a full stack software engineer at Flaitron School. I graduate early December, and can't wait to officially become a developer! 

### _The Last Thing I Worked On_
We just finished our introduction to JavaScript and I _love_ it, it's such a powerful and nuanced language. 

Our final project for this module was an interactive periodic table called [Valence](https://github.com/BenLooper/BABWPTA).

It was a lot of fun to make. It's got some cool styling, and persisting user data using Rails on the backend. 

### _What's Next?_
We're starting to learn React next. I can't wait to learn a framework for the frontend, the next project is going to look **awesome**.

### _Side Projects!_
  - Build up my Pick a Path story program called [Navigator](https://github.com/BenLooper/Navigator)
  - Style my [personal blog](http://benlooper.net/) with my new styling skills
  - Make a basic portfolio site (hosted on Github) to showcase things I'm working on
  - Turn my raspberry pi into an [ad blocker](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/pi-hole-raspberry-pi/) for my apartment!
