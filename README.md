### Hey! ä½ å¥½!

I'm Ben, welcome to my Github!

### _A Little About Me_
I love working with others, systematically attacking problems, and making weird/interesting stuff.

### _My Current Role_
I'm studying to become a full stack software engineer at Flatiron School. Only one more week until I graduate!

### _The Last Thing I Worked On_
I learned some more advanced JavaScript and moved on to React, which I absolutely love.

We finished out that section of the course by making [Stellar](https://github.com/BenLooper/stellar-app), which is an educational platform hooked up to two NASA APIs!

Creating that big of a project in React was very challenging, but now I feel very comfortable with the framework. 

### _What's Next?_
I'm working on my final capston project -- it's due next week ðŸ˜¬ so I'll be hard at work with that. 
I'm very excited to share the finished product. I even learned Redux for it so that my state wasn't so messy! 

### _Side Projects!_
