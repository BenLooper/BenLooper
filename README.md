### Hey! 你好!

I'm Ben, welcome to my Github!

### _A Little About Me_
I love working with others, systematically attacking problems, and making weird/interesting stuff.

### _My Current Role_
I'm an Associate Software Engineer at Infosys - currently in training, then on to contract work! 

### _The Last Thing I Worked On_
I'm currently obsessed with frontend development, specifically React. 

My last substantial project was [Rogue Moon](https://github.com/BenLooper/RogueMoon), a game where you wrestle control of the moon from the clutches of a rogue AI by...playing it in cards (inspired by Gwent from the Witcher 3).  

I loved making this project. It inspired me to continue working with React and to let my imagination run a little wild with my personal projects.

### _What's Next?_
I have an ever growing list of things I'm interested in studying/making in my free time, be sure to look at my side projects for an update on those.
Soon I start 2 months of training at Infosys, and after that I'll start contracting for companies!

### _Side Projects!_
  - Make a beautiful portfolio site that isn't a statically generated Jekyll template
  - Continuously improve Rogue Moon, with the ultimate goal of getting it hosted through AWS
  - Learn Golang 
  - Learn testing for React
