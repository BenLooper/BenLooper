### Hey! 你好!

I'm Ben, welcome to my Github!

### _A Little About Me_
I love working with others, systematically attacking problems, and making weird/interesting stuff.

### _My Current Role_
I'm a full stack software engineer at Gulf Coast Solutions (.NET / React).

### _The Last Thing I Worked On_
I'm diving deeper with ASP.NET Core, currently using it to make an API for a personal project.

My last substantial side project was [Tap Tourney](https://www.taptourney.com/), a community-driven game about tapping as fast as you can (made with AWS Amplify and React). 

At work, I use primarily .NET Core and React to develop functionality for a financial administration platform - projected to be finished in 6 months.

### _What's Next?_
I have an ever growing list of things I'm interested in studying/making in my free time, be sure to check [my website](https://benlooper.tech/) for updates on side projects.
My goal for my next project is to expand upon my knowledge of C# and ASP.NET.

### _Side Projects!_
  - Make the UI for my side project Rogue Moon responsive (don't even try opening it on mobile)
  - Learn Golang 
  - Learn Django
